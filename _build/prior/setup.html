<p>In this tutorial, we will set up a scientific Python computing environment using the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda python distribution by Continuum Analytics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Python?">Why Python?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-Python?"> </a></h2><p>As is true in human language, there are hundreds of computer programming languages. While each has its own merit, the major languages for scientific computing are C, C++, R, MATLAB, Python, Java, and Fortran. MATLAB and Python are similar in syntax and typically read as if they were written in plain english. This makes both languages a useful tool for teaching but they are also very powerful languages and are very actively used in real-life research. MATLAB is proprietary while Python is open source. A benefit of being open source is that anyone can write and release Python packages. For science, there are many wonderful community-driven packages such as NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, and Pandas just to name a few.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-Python-3.7-with-Anaconda">Installing Python 3.7 with Anaconda<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installing-Python-3.7-with-Anaconda"> </a></h2><p>There are several scientific Python distributions available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The  most popular, <a href="https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda">Anaconda</a>, is specifically designed for scientific computing and data science work. For this course, we will use the Anaconda Python 3.7 distribution. To install the correct version, follow the instructions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section">Anaconda download page</a> and download the Python 3.7 graphical installer.</li>
<li>Launch the installer and follow the onscreen instructions.</li>
<li>Congratulations! You now have the beginnings of a scientific Python distribution.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Installing-additional-packages">Installing additional packages<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installing-additional-packages"> </a></h2><p>With the Anaconda Python distribution, you can install verified packages (scientific and non-scientific) through the Conda package manager. Note that you do not have to download Conda separately. This comes packaged with Anaconda. To install packages through Conda, we must manually enter their names on the command line.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open  a prompt.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To open a terminal on OSX, click on the search icon in the upper right-hand corner of your menu bar and type "Terminal". This application is installed by default on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On Windows,  press the “Windows Key” and on the search bar write “Anaconda Prompt”.
2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you will have to type <code>y</code> in your terminal when prompted. This is to ensure that you are aware of what is being installed and what dependencies it requires.</p>
<p>When a library is not available through conda, you can use <code>pip</code>, a package manager with a larger number of libraries but limited to Python.  The syntax for pip is similar. For example, typing <code>pip install [x]</code> in the terminal will install the [x] library.</p>
